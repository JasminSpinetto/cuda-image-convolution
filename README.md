# CUDA Image Convolution

This project implements and optimizes a **2D image convolution algorithm on GPU using CUDA**, comparing performance against a CPU baseline and exploring different parallel configurations.

The focus is on **parallelization, memory access patterns, and performance optimization**, rather than on image processing itself.

---

## Overview

Convolution is a fundamental operation in image processing where each output pixel is computed as a weighted sum of its neighboring input pixels.

This project includes:
- a **CPU implementation** (serial baseline),
- a **GPU implementation using CUDA**,
- an optimized **tiled GPU version using shared memory**,
- and a **performance analysis** across multiple configurations.

---

## Key Results

The GPU implementation achieves a speedup of over **500×** compared to the CPU version.

- CPU execution time: ~56.6 s  
- Best GPU execution time: ~0.10 s  

This demonstrates the effectiveness of GPU parallelization for data-parallel operations like convolution.

## Observations

- GPU acceleration drastically improves performance compared to CPU.
- The best configuration uses:
  - a number of blocks comparable to GPU cores,
  - **32 threads per block (warp size)**.
- Increasing threads does not always improve performance due to:
  - resource contention,
  - scheduling overhead,
  - memory access patterns.
- **Tiling does not significantly improve performance** in this case:
  - convolution is already data-local,
  - tiling overhead outweighs benefits.

## Implementation Details

The project includes the following components:

- `cpu_convolution`: serial convolution baseline  
- `gpu_convolution`: basic CUDA implementation  
- `gpu_tiled_convolution`: shared-memory optimized version  
- `gpu_fill_array`: utility kernel for initialization  

### Optimization Techniques

- Parallelization using CUDA threads and blocks  
- Use of **shared memory** for tiling  
- Careful configuration of:
  - blocks per grid  
  - threads per block  
- Synchronization using `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to ensure accurate timing
